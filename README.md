# swarms
An investigation to decentralized swarming behavior in simple robotic agents.

### Dynamic Reconfiguration

I didn't look immensely into this one because it seemed a little too large and abstract. The flocking seemed like more of a reason to study biology than robotics.

### Third One

This one was similar to first, not much to say.

### Morphogenesis

I liked this one, it was pretty interesting. Seems pretty difficult, but could maybe try ourselves. The results didn't seem too promising though. It seemed like at the start they mentioned starfish shape, but all they ended up with were blobs with indents that seemed somewhat random.
